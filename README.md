The project aims building  a healthcare monitoring system called ‘jitLabs’. It is an innovative Health-ECO System Platform that can Track your healthcare vitals, promptly alert, do big data analysis, educate the user, and connect with different health care professionals include your family, your doctor etc. The entire system consists of a medical device which can measure the important health vitals and connect to a hub which can be a mobile/tablet device, a web portal through which patient/doctor/family connects, an automated analysis system which can send alerts and analyze the data in real time. jitLabs provides real time alerts as emails to family/doctor/patient whenever system see an abnormal elevation in the health vitals. The current system measures Heart rate, Heart rate variability index, Respiration SPO 2, Blood pressure,  Blood Oxygen, Core body temperature, Ambiance temperature, Humidity. The entire analysis/alert system resides in cloud. jitLabs used Amazon Web Services as the cloud provider as AWS  gives us highly available fault tolerant systems.
