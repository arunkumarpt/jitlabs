# jitlabs

The project aims at building a healthcare monitoring system called ‘jitLabs’. It is an innovative Health- ECO System Platform that can track your body vitals and use the collected healthcare data to do big data analysis, relay prompt alerts, educate the users, connect with your health care provider/family etc.
The entire system consists of the following:

 - A medical device which can measure the important health vitals
 - A hub which can be a mobile/tablet device
 - A web portal through which patient/doctor/family connects
 - An automated analysis system which can analyze the data in real time and send alerts.

jitLabs provide real time alerts as emails to family/doctor/patient whenever system identifies an abnormal elevation in the health vitals. The current system measures Heart rate, Heart rate variability index, Respiration SPO 2, Blood pressure, Blood Oxygen, Core body temperature, Ambiance temperature and Humidity. The entire /alert system resides in cloud and analysis too happens there. jitLabs uses Amazon Web Services as the cloud provider as AWS facilitates the creation of highly available fault tolerant systems.
